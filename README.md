# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- npm install react-router react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers yup axios tailwindcss@latest @tailwindcss/vite@latest daisyui@latest react-icons react-toastify typewriter-effect react-simple-typewriter sweetalert2 sweetalert2-react-content swiper framer-motion eslint prettier

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
